## Features

- Interactive grid where cells live, die, and evolve by classic Game of Life rules
- Start/Stop/Reset/Clear controls
- Pattern import module with `X offset`, `Y offset`, and custom `RLE` string support
- Real-time display of:
  - Generation count
  - FPS (frames per second)
  - Population
- Mouse interaction:
  - Drawing cells (left click)
  - Erasing cells (right click)
  - Panning and zooming
- MVVM architecture with `INotifyPropertyChanged`
- Efficient bitmap-based rendering using `WriteableBitmap`

##  Built-in Patterns
You can load some sample Life patterns using the built-in pattern loader:

- Turing

- Omaton

- Corder

- Calculator

- Gun

- Spiral

You can get more patterns from [ConwayLife Patterns Library](https://conwaylife.com/patterns/).
> [!NOTE]
> Only files using `.rle` format and below board limit of `2060x2060` cells
